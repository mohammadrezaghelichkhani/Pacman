Pacman: A Classic Arcade Game
Description:

Pacman is a classic arcade game where you control a yellow character named Pacman who navigates a maze, eating dots while avoiding ghosts. Your goal is to rack up points before losing all your lives.

Gameplay:

Movement: Use the arrow keys to steer Pacman:
Up (w): Moves Pacman up.
Left (a): Moves Pacman left.
Down (s): Moves Pacman down.
Right (d): Moves Pacman right.
Dots: Munching on small dots earns you a classic 10 points each.
Power Pellets: Spotting a large yellow pellet (represented by 'o') grants you a temporary power-up. During this empowered state, the tables turn! You can gobble up the ghosts for a sweet 200 points each, instead of losing a life if they touch you.
Ghosts: Four colorful ghosts chase Pacman around the maze. Difficulty modes affect their behavior:
Easy: The ghosts take a relaxed approach, moving randomly.
Medium: Two ghosts become more determined, tracking Pacman, while the other two stick to their random paths.
Hard: All four ghosts become relentless hunters, actively chasing Pacman down.
Lives: You start with 3 lives. If a ghost touches Pacman when not powered-up, you lose a life. The game ends when you lose all your lives.
Enjoy the thrill of the chase and see how high you can score!
